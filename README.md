> > Website Overview

# This project consists of a multi-page website designed to provide an interactive and dynamic user experience. Below is an overview of how to navigate the site, the structure of the files, and some important notes.

> > Navigation Flow

1.  Start Page (load.html)

    # The website begins at load.html. Once the user interacts with the page (by clicking on anywhere), they are directed to the main page (mainPage.html).

2.  Main Page (mainPage.html)

    # From the main page, users can explore different sections using the navigation bar.

    For example, if the user navigates to the "Dinner" section and selects a meal, they will be redirected to view1.html.

3.  View Meal Page (view1.html)

    # On this page, users can share and like the selected meal.

    # If the user wants more details about the meal, they can click a button that will take them to view2.html.

4.  Meal Details Page (view2.html)

    # This page displays detailed information about the selected meal.

    All meal details on this page are dynamically loaded from the \* mealInfo.json file.

- Videos: Videos are provided in a zipped format and must be extracted before use, also due to size considerations.

- All names and descriptions on this website are for sample purposes only.

# NB:- Make sure to extract all zipped files and ensure a stable internet connection for loading cloud-hosted images.
